## 🎓 Student Performance Analysis & Prediction

This project showcases a complete data science workflow—from exploratory analysis to machine learning and full-stack deployment. Built around a student performance dataset, it demonstrates how data-driven insights can be transformed into an interactive web application using Flask and HTML.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

- **Demographics**: Gender, race/ethnicity, parental education
- **Support Factors**: Lunch type, test preparation course
- **Scores**: Math, Reading, Writing

Each record represents a student, and the goal is to analyze performance drivers and predict academic outcomes.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights uncovered:

- 📊 Score distributions across subjects
- 🧠 Performance gaps by gender and ethnicity
- 🍱 Lunch type correlation with scores
- 📚 Test preparation impact
- 📈 Feature correlations and outliers

Visualizations were created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to support data storytelling.

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

A robust prediction pipeline was built using:

- **Preprocessing**: Encoding, scaling, missing value handling
- **Modeling**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression
- **Evaluation**: RMSE, R², MAE
- **Optimization**: GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

---

## 🌐 Web Deployment with Flask

To make the model accessible, a lightweight Flask app was developed:

- 🖥️ **Frontend**: HTML-based form for user input
- 🔌 **Backend**: Flask routes for prediction and rendering
- 🚀 **User Experience**: Instant prediction of student scores based on input features
